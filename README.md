# Airbnb Module Application Code

This repository contains the codes for the Module Application, which is a Python module that provides functionality for analyzing and exploring data related to a specific domain.

## Features

- Data loading: Load data from various sources such as CSV files, databases, or APIs.
- Data Processing and Analysis: Clean, transform, and aggregate data to generate insights and extract valuable information through statistical analysis.
- Data visualization: Create visual representations of the data using plots, charts, and graphs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

#### Introduction to Airbnb

Airbnb, as in “Air Bed and Breakfast,” is a service that lets property owners rent out
their spaces to travellers looking for a place to stay. Travelers can rent a space for
multiple people to share, a shared space with private rooms, or the entire property
for themselves. With Airbnb, you can stay in unique and local accommodations in
cities all around the world.

#### Project Aim:
The aim of the project is to analyze and explore the Airbnb dataset to gain insights into various aspects of Airbnb listings, hosts, and guest experiences. The project involves loading the dataset, performing data processing and analysis, and visualizing the data to uncover patterns, trends, and useful information.

#### Project Objectives:
1. Load the Airbnb dataset: The project involves loading the Airbnb dataset, which contains information about Airbnb listings, including attributes such as location, price, amenities, ratings, and reviews.

2. Data processing and analysis: Perform data processing tasks such as cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis. Conduct various analyses on the dataset to gain insights into host characteristics, guest preferences, pricing patterns, and other relevant factors.

3. Visualization: Create visual representations of the data using plots, charts, and graphs to effectively communicate the findings. Visualizations help in understanding patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

##### To utilize this application you need:
* You will need the CSV file path 

##### Brief Discussion of the Dataset:
The Airbnb dataset used in this project contains information about Airbnb listings, hosts, and guest reviews. It provides a rich set of attributes that can be utilized to analyze various aspects of the Airbnb ecosystem.

The dataset typically includes information such as:
- Listing details: Location, property type, room type, number of bedrooms, price, minimum and maximum nights allowed, availability, etc.
- Host details: Host ID, host name, host response rate, host response time, superhost status, etc.
- Guest reviews: Ratings, comments, date of the review, reviewer ID, etc.

The dataset offers a comprehensive view of the Airbnb marketplace, enabling analysis of factors such as pricing trends, popular amenities, host characteristics, guest satisfaction, and more.

By exploring and analyzing this dataset, valuable insights can be derived, which can be beneficial for various stakeholders, including Airbnb hosts, guests, and the company itself.

##### Charateristics of the data
* This is a CSV data
* The data file, Airbnb_UK_2022.csv, contains 34 columns.
* Each row in the file represents a single record for a listing. 
* The data set containscomplete data for all columns for each record in the file. 
* This means that there are no missing values.

#### About the application
* This takes a CSV file for data input 
* It is sectioned into 3 main part for your esay accessiblity using A,B, and C respectively:
    * Retrieving data from a CSV file
    * Analyzing data using the pandas module
    * Visualisation the data
* The 3 section was further broken down and are assigned a unique integer to call them
